        <h2 id="spacingOut">Spacing Out</h2>

        <p>
            PowerShell is far more forgiving than most scripting and programming languages. Some languages will generate
            errors if you have a single space by itself on an otherwise blank line, but with PowerShell, you can have
            code formatted like this (this is stolen from the Collections Hands-On article, but with the formatting
            absolutely destroyed):
        </p>

        <div class="vscode-snippet">
            <pre class="language-powershell" data-prismjs-copy="Copy"><code id="ho101"></code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            And at the same time, you could format that exact same command as a single line, like this:
        </p>

        <div class="vscode-snippet">
            <pre class="language-powershell" data-prismjs-copy="Copy"><code id="ho102"></code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            So don't be too worried if an example you find here or elsewhere online looks different -- spacing barely
            matters at all in PowerShell.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll sometimes see lines entered with the equals sign all aligned, like this:
        </p>

        <div class="vscode-snippet">
            <pre class="language-powershell" data-prismjs-copy="Copy"><code id="ho103"></code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>This can actually help tremendously when your scripts get long enough to become difficult to parse at a
            glance.</p>

        <h2 id="toolsToUse">Tools you can use (you sould probably use Visual Studio Code)</h2>

        <p>
            If you're just plain sloppy with code, however, there are tools built into most editors you can use. For
            instance, in Visual Studio Code, you can use a keyboard shortcut to format your code. In Windows, if you
            press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>, you can turn this bit of sloppy code:
        </p>

        <div class="vscode-snippet">
            <pre class="language-powershell" data-prismjs-copy="Copy"><code id="ho104"></code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>...into this:</p>

        <div class="vscode-snippet">
            <pre class="language-powershell" data-prismjs-copy="Copy"><code id="ho105"></code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            As Visual Studio Code (not to be confused with Visual Studio!) is pretty close to being an industry
            standard, it's a good idea to get yourself acquainted with it. It's not just good for PowerShell - thanks to
            its extensible nature, you can comfortably write in any language you wish.
        </p>

        <h2 id="commenting">Commenting</h2>

        <p>
            A very important part of easy-to-follow code is good commenting. As your functions get more and more
            complicated, even good formatting can let you down when you need to find something very specific.
        </p>

        <p>
            Comments are lines in your code that, well, aren't code. They can say anything you want, really, but mostly
            should be used as a way to remind yourself of why you did something, where you can find a definition for a
            function, or just a way to say "please fix this later" when you know you did something <strong>very</strong>
            sloppily.
        </p>

        <p>
            In PowerShell, you can insert comments one of two ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            A single line comment begin with a hash character (<code>#</code>) - these are useful for quick, short
            comments. These can be used at the end of a line, but anything that comes after one of these on a single
            line will be commented out. These can also be used for bug-testing if you think a single line is causing you
            an issue - just pop one at the beginning of a line and none of the code after it will proceed.
        </p>

        <p>
            A block comment begins with <code>&lt;#</code> and ends with <code>#&gt;</code>. Unlike single-line
            comments, a block comment, once started, will just keep on going until you close it out. It's mostly used
            for more in-depth descriptions of how to use a function or command. However, it can also be used to comment
            things out inline with other code.
        </p>

        <h4>Examples</h4>

        <div class="vscode-snippet">
            <pre class="language-powershell" data-prismjs-copy="Copy"><code id="ho106"></code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            You'll see pretty heavy use of comments in example code in upcoming tutorials - it's an easy way to keep
            some notes along with your work, and a little reminder to why you did whatever weird thing you did last
            month might save you a lot of trouble when trying to decipher your own handiwork later on.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>In this tutorial, we should have picked up a few pointers.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Don't sweat spacing too much - use it to your advantage when organizing code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the tools you have at your disposal. You <em>can</em> write a working script in Notepad, but Visual
                Studio Code or another editor will make your life <strong>much</strong> easier.
            </li>
            <li>
                Comment your code! Use single-line comments for quick reminders or block comments for when you really
                need a novel to explain to future-you why you did something. And when you are perusing someone else's
                code, be sure to read their comments - they put them there for a reason, usually.
            </li>
        </ol>
